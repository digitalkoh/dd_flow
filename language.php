        <h3>Use your Health Savings Account (HSA)</h3>
        <p>If you enroll in this plan, you can save money when you participate in the HSA. Start saving now and use it later. The HSA doesn’t have the same "use it or lose it rule" that apply to a Flexible Spending Account. The funds in an HSA are yours to keep and use for eligible health care expenses.</p>
        <h3>Limited Scope Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</h3>
        <p>With an HSA you are also eligible for the Limited Scope Flexible Spending Account. If you enroll in a medical plan with a Health Savings Account (HSA), you may only use the FSA to pay for eligible dental and vision expenses. According to IRS rules, you cannot use the FSA to pay for medical expenses that are also eligible for reimbursement through the Health Savings Account (HSA). You can set aside as little as $250 or up to $2,500 each year.</p>
