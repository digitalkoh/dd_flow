    <strong>Prescription Coverage</strong>
    The Right Choice for Marci &mdash; HSA Plan
</p>
<p>
    "With my son’s asthma diagnosis, I know my family will use more health care services next year. I’d rather pay more out of my paycheck each month so I can meet my deductible faster. I know I’ll need the coverage so it makes sense for me to pay the higher premium. I used the Flexible Spending Account Estimator to help determine how much to set aside for the increased prescription costs I know I’ll have next year, and I made sure my son’s asthma medication is on the prescription formulary. The HSA Plan was a good fit for my family’s needs."
