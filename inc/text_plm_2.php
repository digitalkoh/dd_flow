    <strong>Budget-Conscious</strong>
    The Right Choice for Marci &mdash; HSA Plan
</p>
<p>
    "My husband, Nick, and I don't get sick much, but I worry about what would happen to our finances if one of us got sick or was seriously injured. I compared all the different plans, and figured out what we expect to spend for medical care next year with the Medical Expense Estimator. I enrolled in the HSA Plan because of the set copays. I know the premiums are higher, but our budget doesn't allow for a lot of flexibility. It's reassuring to know exactly how much we'll spend at the doctor's office and pharmacy. We can get all our preventive screenings paid at 100% by going to a doctor in the plan's network."
