    The Right Choice for Steve &mdash; HSA Plan
</p>
<p>
    "I don't get sick much, but I guess I'm a bit accident-prone when it comes to sports. I used the Medical Expense Estimator to get a handle on how much I really expect to spend at the doctor next year. I decided the HSA Plan would be my best option. Although the monthly premiums are higher than the other Medical Plan options, I like knowing exactly what my copay amount will be at the doctor's office and pharmacy. I'm willing to pay higher monthly premiums in exchange for having a set copay. And I like the FSA. I’ll need new glasses next year, so I’m planning to set aside $200 pre-tax for that purchase."
